# Algorithms
## A collection of C and C++ implementations of some interesting topics.

***See comments in the codes for detail about the programs:***

1. ***curveBreakpointsProces*** -- C and C++ programs to process curve file to reduce the number of breakpoints.   
2. ***paradromicPatterns***     -- C and C++ program to pick out paradromic patterns from a string, like "abba", "cdc", "abccba", etc.   
3. ***num_0s_between_1s.c***    -- C program to find out those continuous 0 bits between two 1 bits in an integer.   
4. ***array_operations.c***     -- C program contains functions for basic array operations: sort array, reverse integer array, reverse and move integer array section and find even elements in a integer array.
