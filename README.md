# Algorithms
A collection of C and C++ implementations of some interesting topics.

See comments in the codes for detail about the programs:

curveBreakpointsProces -- C and C++ programs to process curve file to reduce the number of breakpoints.

paradromicPatterns     -- C and C++ program to pick out paradromic patterns from a string, like "abba", "cdc", "abccba", etc.

num_0s_between_1s.c    -- C program to find out those continuous 0 bits between two 1 bits in an integer.

array_operations.c     -- C program contains functions to sort array, reverse integer array, reverse and move integer array section and find even elements in a integer array.
