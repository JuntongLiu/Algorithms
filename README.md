# Algorithms
## C, C++ and Rust implementations of some interesting topics.

***<span style="color:green;">See comments</span> in the codes for detail about the programs:***

1. <span style="color:green;">***curveBreakpointsProces***</span> -- C, C++ and Rust programs to process curve breakpoints file to reduce the number of breakpoints.
2. <span style="color:green;">***curve_process_visualization***</span>   -- Rust GUI program which processes and visualizes curve with breakpoints.
3. <span style="color:green;">***paradromicPatterns***</span>    -- C and C++ program to pick out paradromic patterns from a string, like "abba", "cdc", "abccba", etc.   
4. <span style="color:green;">***num_0s_between_1s.c***</span>   -- C program to find out continuous 0 bits between two 1 bits in an integer.
5. <span style="color:green;">***array_operations.c***</span>   -- C program contains functions for basic array operations: sort array, reverse integer array, reverse and move integer array section and find even elements in a integer array.   
6. <span style="color:green;">***num_0s_between_1s.rs***</span>  -- Rust program to find out continuous 0 bits between two 1 bits in an integer.
