# Algorithms
## A collection of C, C++ and Rust implementations of some interesting topics.

***See comments in the codes for detail about the programs:***

1. <span style="color:green">some ***curveBreakpointsProces*** text</span> -- C and C++ programs to process curve file to reduce the number of breakpoints.   
2. <span style="color:green">some ***paradromicPatterns*** text</span>    -- C and C++ program to pick out paradromic patterns from a string, like "abba", "cdc", "abccba", etc.   
3. <span style="color:green">some ***num_0s_between_1s.c*** text</span>   -- C program to find out continuous 0 bits between two 1 bits in an integer.
4. <span style="color:green">some ***array_operations.c***  text</span>   -- C program contains functions for basic array operations: sort array, reverse integer array, reverse and move integer array section and find even elements in a integer array.   
5. <span style="color:green">some ***num_0s_between_1s.rs*** text</span>  -- Rust program to find out continuous 0 bits between two 1 bits in an integer.
